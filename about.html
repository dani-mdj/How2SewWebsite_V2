              Hi there, thanks for being here! My name is Danielle, and I am
              sewing instructor and garment maker with a passion for helping
              others create clothing that fits well and makes them feel good.
            </p>

                When I first learned to sew as a kid, I was just making
                everything up &mdash; including the rules.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              I've been sewing since childhood, starting by making up my own
              patterns and learning through experience. My skills grew
              significantly while working at Seams Fabric in East Lansing,
              Michigan, where I spent three years as a shop clerk, social media
              manager, and sewing instructor. After moving to Ottawa in 2023, I
              worked as an assistant manager and instructor at Fabrications
              Ottawa before shifting my focus to private sewing lessons and my
              studies.

              My specialty is garment sewing, and I love helping people make
              clothing that truly fits their body and personal style. Some of my
              proudest projects include making my high school graduation dress,
              my own wedding attire, and tackling complex garments like jeans
              and bras. I have also done some quilting and bag making projects
              which were also a fun accomplishment for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a teacher, I take an easygoing and encouraging approach, making
              sure my students feel confident with their sewing machines and
              projects. I believe in progress over perfectionâ€”sewing should be
              enjoyable, and mistakes are just part of the learning process. I
              especially love private lessons, where I can tailor my teaching to
              each student's pace and goals.

              A finished project can be perfect even if you didn't sew
              perfectly.

              My goal is to empower others to create clothing they love and feel
              comfortable in and to develop the skills to take on any project
              (not necessarily clothing!). Whether you're a beginner or looking
              to take on a more advanced project, I'd love to help you build the
              skills and confidence to bring your sewing ideas to life!

                Whatever your project I'm ready and excited to help you bring
                your sewing ideas to life!
